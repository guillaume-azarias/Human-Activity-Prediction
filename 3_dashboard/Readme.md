This is a script to show a dashboard during the final project presentation.

Since it will not be further used by the company, it is not interactive in term of 
data plotting, but only shows example traces from our analysis results.

To run the script, open the Terminal, go to the folder where it is located, then run:
streamlit run Dashboard_strealit_v4.py
