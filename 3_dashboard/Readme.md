# Dashboard

The goal of the dashboard is to create a **Remote Monitoring Solution** for caregivers and family members, to check if the resident had a usual activity in the last 24 hours. For a full explanation, please view the [project presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4BGwj-aBA).

To run the script, open the Terminal, go to the folder where it is located, then run:
streamlit run Dashboard_strealit.py

*Please note that it is not interactive in term of data plotting, but only shows example traces from our analysis results.*
